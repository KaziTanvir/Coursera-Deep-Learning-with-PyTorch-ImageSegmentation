<h1>Deep Learning with PyTorch : Image Segmentation  </h1>
Objectives:
  i)   Understand the Segmentation Dataset and write a custom dataset class for Image-mask dataset. Additionally, apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as          well as its masks. For image-mask augmentation use albumentation library.

  ii)  Load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network for segmentation problem(for e.g, Unet) using segmentation model pytorch library. 

  iii) Create train function and evaluator function which will helpful to write training loop. Moreover, use training loop to train the model.
